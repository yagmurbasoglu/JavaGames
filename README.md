# JavaGames
I am writing games using java in this repository. I write and install the games I write in both 2D and 3D using normal Java beginner level and OOP.

# 1) Minesweeper Game
This is a Minesweeper game developed using the Java programming language. The main objective of the game is to find all the mines and open all the cells that are not mines. The player must guess the location of the mines by examining the game board and win the game.

### ***Game rules***
There is a game board in the game. This board is created with the number of rows, columns and mines received from the user, and the mines are randomly distributed within this board.
The player tries to open the cells on the board. When a cell is opened, the number inside shows the number of mines adjacent to that cell.

The player can also flag a cell. It is used to determine whether there are mines under the flagged cells.

Once the mine is opened, the game is lost and the game is over. The user can play again if they want.

When all cells without mines are opened, the game is won and the game ends. The user can play again if they want.

### ***How to play***
When the game starts, the game board will be displayed. The symbol '#' represents an unopened cell, the symbol 'F' represents a flagged cell. Numbers indicate the number of mines around the cell.

Enter row and column numbers to open a cell. Select "Y" to mark a cell. To remove the flag from a cell and continue the game with the '#' symbol again, type the same row and column and select "Y" when asked to add the flag again. If you want to open that cell while removing the flag, write the same row and column and select "N". The flag will be removed and if there is no mine or one number of mines, you will see the message that the game is over.

Examine the cells on the board carefully to win or lose the game.
When you win or lose the game, if you want to start a new game, you can start a new game by using the "Y" or "N" option.
### ***Folders***

The normal and OOP versions of this game and the 3D version are available in separate files. You can find the relevant codes in the links below:                                                                                                                                         

***NOTE***
These written codes are at a simple level. Some new features such as time keeping and score keeping will be added as soon as the game updates.
